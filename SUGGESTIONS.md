# Suggestions

### Project
- Missing .gitignore

### README
- Missing link to tasks.md
- Missing tasks.md
- The desciption of the project lacks the explaination what it does... give it a back story
- No need to mention that you copy/pasted something

### Ansible.cfg
- Inventory is given without path `inventory=hosts.ini` >> `inventory=./hosts.ini`
- if the value to inventory is passed from jenkins file, it is usually overriden in file, thus file is either not needed or misconfigured.
